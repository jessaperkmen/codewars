'''
Write a function that takes an (unsigned) integer as input, and returns the number of bits that are equal to one in the binary representation of that number.

Example: The binary representation of 1234 is 10011010010, so the function should return 5 in this case

def countBits(n):
    return  list(bin(n)[2:]).count('1')
